# Installation instructions
## Dependencies
### libsndfile
OpenL3 depends on the pysoundfile module to load audio files, which depends on the non-Python library libsndfile. On Windows and macOS, these will be installed via pip and you can therefore skip this step. However, on Linux this must be installed manually via your platformâ€™s package manager. For Debian-based distributions (such as Ubuntu), this can be done by simply running

```apt-get install libsndfile1```

Alternatively, if you are using conda, you can install libsndfile simply by running

```conda install -c conda-forge libsndfile```

For more detailed information, please consult the pysoundfile installation documentation.

### Tensorflow
Starting with openl3>=0.4.0, Openl3 has been upgraded to use Tensorflow 2. Because Tensorflow 2 and higher now includes GPU support, tensorflow>=2.0.0 is included as a dependency and no longer needs to be installed separately.

If you are interested in using Tensorflow 1.x, please install using pip install 'openl3<=0.3.1'.

### Tensorflow 1x & OpenL3 <= v0.3.1
Because Tensorflow 1.x comes in CPU-only and GPU variants, we leave it up to the user to install the version that best fits their usecase.

On most platforms, either of the following commands should properly install Tensorflow:

```pip install "tensorflow<1.14" # CPU-only version```
```pip install "tensorflow-gpu<1.14" # GPU version```
## Installing OpenL3

The simplest way to install OpenL3 is by using pip, which will also install the additional required dependencies if needed. To install OpenL3 using pip, simply run

```pip install openl3```

To install the latest version of OpenL3 from source:

Clone or pull the latest version, only retrieving the main branch to avoid downloading the branch where we store the model weight files (these will be properly downloaded during installation).

```git clone git@github.com:marl/openl3.git --branch main --single-branch```

Install using pip to handle python dependencies. The installation also downloads model files, which requires a stable network connection.

```cd openl3```
```pip install -e .```
